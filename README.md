# QuadPtsBielliptic
The code from the article "QUADRATIC POINTS ON BIELLIPTIC MODULAR CURVES" by F. Najman and B. Vukorepa

We determine all quadratic points on bielliptic X0(n) by building upon the work of Box: QUADRATIC POINTS ON MODULAR CURVES WITH INFINITE MORDELLâ€“WEIL GROUP

Key points:
  1) Symmetric Chabauty (Box's method)
  2) Relative Chabauty (Box's method)
  3) Partial Chabauty (Unofficial Box's method + our improvements)
  4) Infinite-index Chabauty (our improvements)
